  <h1>Land of Africa</h1>
  <img class="top-image" src="/img/thin-pattern.jpg" alt="thin-pattern">
  <h3>Relief</h3>
  <p>
    The physiography of Africa is essentially a reflection of the geologic history and geology
    that is described in the previous section. The continent, composed largely of a vast rigid
    block of ancient rocks, has geologically young mountains at its extremities in the highlands
    of the Atlas Mountains in the northwest and the Cape ranges in the south. Between these
    mountainous areas is a series of plateau surfaces, with huge areas that are level or
    slightly undulating, above which stand occasional harder and more resistant rock masses.
    Surrounding these surfaces is a zone of plateau slopes below which are narrow coastal
    belts widening along the Mediterranean coast, the coastlands of Tanzania and Mozambique,
    a narrow belt between the Niger and Cunene (Kunene) rivers, and an area northward of the
    Gambia and Sénégal rivers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kilimanjaro (19,340 feet [5,895 metres]) is the highest point on the continent; the lowest
    is Lake Assal (515 feet [157 metres] below sea level) in Djibouti. In proportion to its size,
    Africa has fewer high mountains and fewer lowland plains than any other continent. The limited
    areas above 8,000 feet are either volcanic peaks or resistant massifs. All the land below 500
    feet occurs within 500 miles of the coast, except for two small basins in the Sahara.
    <br>

    <img src="/img/Kilimanjaro.jpg" alt="mountain">
    <br>
    The higher areas of the south and east are in marked contrast to the considerably lower elevation of
    the western and northern parts of the continent. South of a line drawn from near the mouth of the
    Congo River to the Gulf of Aden, most of the land lies 1,000 feet or more above sea level,
    and much of it exceeds 3,000 and even 4,000 feet. North of the line there is relatively little
    land above 3,000 feet, most of the area being between 500 and 1,000 feet above sea level;
    there are also broad coastal lowlands, except in the region of the Atlas Mountains and,
    in the east, beyond the Nile.
    <br>
    <br>
    The highest extensive areas are to be found in Ethiopia, parts of which exceed 15,000 feet.
    Southward the East African Plateau is highest in Kenya, where it is often 8,000 feet or more
    above sea level; there are occasional volcanic peaks that are much higher, such as Kilimanjaro,
    Mount Kenya (17,058 feet), Meru (14,978 feet), and Elgon (14,178 feet). The Ruwenzori (Rwenzori)
    Range—sometimes called the Mountains of the Moon—which reaches its highest elevation at Margherita
    Peak (16,795 feet) on the borders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, is not volcanic
    in origin. <br> From East Africa the plateau extends southward, often with a well-defined though not
    continuous escarpment particularly noticeable in the Drakensberg of Southern Africa, where Ntlenyana,
    or Ntshonyana, is 11,424 feet and Mont-aux-Sources 10,823 feet high.
  </p>
  <img src="/img/morocco.jpg" alt="">
  <p>
    To the north and west of the plateau area of the southern parts of the continent there is a general
    descent to the lower areas of the basins of the Congo, Niger, and Nile rivers. The only large areas
    that extend above 3,000 feet are in the folded ranges of the Atlas Mountains and in the central Sahara,
    where resistant granites form the massifs of Ahaggar and Tibesti.<br> The interior uplands of western Africa
    and of Cameroon consist of ancient crystalline rocks, reaching considerable heights only in the Fouta
    Djallon plateau in Guinea, in the Guinea Highlands, which also extend over the borders of Sierra Leone
    and Liberia, in the Jos Plateau in Nigeria, in the Adamawa region of Nigeria and Cameroon, and in the
    Cameroon Highlands. <br> <br>There are extensive low-lying areas near the coast and in the basins of the Sénégal,
    Gambia, Volta, and Niger–Benue rivers. The high areas of Darfur in Sudan (more than 10,000 feet) and of
    Mount Cameroon (13,435 feet) are volcanic in origin and are evidence of the same tensions that have
    resulted in rifting and volcanism in East Africa.
    <br>
  <p>
  The East African Rift System constitutes the most striking and distinctive relief feature of the continent.
  Associated with its formation was the volcanic activity responsible for most of the higher peaks of East Africa,
  including Kilimanjaro. Seismic and volcanic disturbances are still recorded in the western portions of the rift
  valley system. In the Virunga Mountains, northeast of Lake Kivu, there are periodic outbursts (about every 10
  or 12 years) that have created a series of lava flows. One of these volcanoes dammed the rift valley and
  converted a large area, formerly drained by a tributary of the Nile, into Lake Kivu.

  <br>
  <h3>Drainage</h3>
  <p>
    The uplifting and warping of the surface of the African continent that occurred during the Pliocene and
    Pleistocene epochs produced a number of structural basins; these are now either individually occupied by,
    or are linked up with, drainage systems. With the exception of the Chad basin, all the major drainage basins
    have outlets to the sea. In addition, minor drainage basins, similar to that of Lake Chad, are situated in
    the East African Rift Valley. Some, again like Lake Chad, constitute the focus of centripetal drainage
    (drainage directed toward the centre), while others are linked to river systems. Although the East African
    lakes are climatically and economically important, relatively little is known of their hydrological
    characteristics.
    <br><br>
    Climate, geology, and the history of tectonic activity have imparted certain common characteristics to
    African rivers. Spatial variations in the incidence and amount of rainfall are reflected in their hydrological
    regimes. In areas that have one rainfall season, for example, and have pronounced drought throughout the rest
    of the year, the rivers flood in the rainy season and shrink in the dry season.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whatever their hydrological regimes, all the important African rivers are interrupted by rapids, cataracts,
    and waterfalls. This is explained by several factors, the most important of which is the past tectonic
    activity, or regional land movements, that caused ridges to be formed across the courses of the major rivers.
    Waterfalls are often found where the rivers are still engaged in cutting downward as they flow across these
    ridges; Cahora Bassa (falls) on the Zambezi and the Augrabies Falls on the Orange River are examples.
    Another factor that contributes to the creation of rapids or falls is the incidence of rock strata that have
    proved resistant to the erosive effect of the rivers’ flow. (Tropical rivers do not generally carry large
    quantities of stone or rock; instead, they have a tendency to carry loads of fine silt, produced by chemical
    weathering.)
  </p>

  <h3>Nile basin</h3>
  <p>
    There are two theories concerning the development of the Nile, which, it appears, originally consisted of
    two sections. The first theory is that the lower Nile had its source at about latitude 20° N, whence it
    flowed directly into the sea, while the upper Nile, issuing from Lake Victoria, flowed into an inland lake
    that covered the Al-Sudd region in what is now South Sudan. The lake became filled with water, which then
    spilled over at its northern end and flowed into what is now the lower Nile. According to the second theory,
    the upper section originally flowed into a vast lake between Mount Al-Silsilah (near Luxor, Egypt) and what
    is now Aswān; this was tapped by the lower section of the Nile after the so-called Sebile erosion (which takes
    its name from the fact that the breakthrough by the lower Nile was identified at Sebile).
  </p>
  <img src="/img/nile-basin.jpeg" alt="basin">
  <p>
    The Nile, which is about 4,132 miles long, is the longest river in the world. From Lake Victoria it flows,
    as the Victoria Nile, into Lake Albert, from which it emerges as the Albert Nile. Farther north it is known
    as the Al-Jabal River. Thereafter, having received several tributaries, it becomes the White Nile and
    finally the Nile, emptying at last into the Mediterranean Sea. Its major left-bank tributary is the
    Al-Ghazāl, and the largest right-bank tributaries are the Sobat, Blue Nile, and Atbara.<br><br> Because of the
    numerous rapids and waterfalls, the Nile descends fairly rapidly from source to mouth, as do its major
    right-bank tributaries. This is especially true of the Blue Nile, which, after issuing from Lake Tana on
    the Ethiopian Plateau at a height of approximately 6,000 feet, flows for most of its length through a steep
    gorge. Swamps also interrupt the river’s course. Of these the largest is Al-Sudd, a vast area of floating
    swamp reeds, mostly papyrus.
  </p>

  <img src="/img/nile-river.jfif" alt="river">
  <p>
    The river’s regime is now controlled by a series of dams situated on the Nile itself or on one of its
    various tributaries; of these, the largest is the Aswan High Dam on the main Nile.
  </p>
  <h3>Soil types</h3>
  <p>
    In general, soil types on the African continent may be divided into five or six broad categories.
    There are desert soils; chestnut-brown soils, which border the deserts; and chernozem-like soils
    (dark black soils rich in humus and carbonates), which are found immediately south of the chestnut
    soils from Sudan westward to just beyond the Niger Bend (the bend in the middle course of the Niger
    River) and pockets of which are also found in East Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa.<br>
    In addition, there are black soils (often grouped with chernozems), and found on the Accra Plains
    of Ghana; red tropical soils and laterites (leached red iron-bearing soils), which occur in the
    tropical wet-and-dry and equatorial climatic zones; and Mediterranean soils, found in the Atlas
    Mountains of North Africa and the Cape region of South Africa.
  </p>
   <img src="/img/Soil in Hand.jpg" alt="soil">
  <p>The most important factors that affect soil formation are climate, parent material, relief,
    drainage, vegetation cover, and the passage of time. Where the land has been generally stable and
    fairly flat for prolonged periods, as in Africa, the climate becomes the major determinant of the
    soil groups.<br><br>The different rocks are deeply weathered and are broken down into their common component
    elements to produce broadly similar soils under the same climatic conditions. Given sufficient time
    under a tropical climate, the differences in humus content of the great soil groups, which are
    introduced by vegetation types, are minimized. But within these groups there will naturally be
    differences in soil types as a function of local differences in physical factors.
  </p>
  <h3>Soil Problems</h3>
  <p>
    Soil is the foundation of Africa’s economic life, and as such its detailed study is most important.
    Failure to appreciate the physical and chemical properties of the soils has led to disastrous results
    for several projects for agricultural improvement.
    <br><br>
    In studying the soils of Africa, it is essential not to lose sight of the importance of such social
    factors as the ability or inability of mostly uneducated farmers to judge the quality of the soil.
    Thus, schemes for transforming traditional systems of farming that are based on soil classification
    but that do not take into account local perception may have little chance of success.
  </p>
  <p>
    For desert soils to be productive they must be irrigated, as they are on the desert margins of North
    Africa; their excessive salinity or alkalinity must also be reduced. Compared to desert soils,
    the chestnut-brown soils are easier to work and are more productive under irrigation. Black soils
    tend to have a markedly crumbly structure and are sometimes difficult to plow. In the wet season,
    the black soils of the Accra Plains swell and become slippery, while in the dry season they shrink
    once more and crack to such an extent that they are said to plow themselves.<br> Red tropical soils need
    careful handling. Despite their luxuriant vegetation cover, high temperatures coupled with humidity
    promote the rapid decay of organic matter and keep the humus content low. Erosion is a constant
    threat if the soils are exposed to the elements for any length of time; the soils remain cultivable
    only if the sesquioxides remain below the surface.
