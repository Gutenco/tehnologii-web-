      <p>
        The African continent essentially consists of five ancient Precambrian cratons—Kaapvaal,
        Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Congo, and West African—that were formed between about 3.6 and 2
        billion years ago and that basically have been tectonically stable since that time; those
        cratons are bounded by younger fold belts formed between 2 billion and 300 million years ago.
        All of those rocks have been extensively folded and metamorphosed (that is, they have been
        modified in composition and structure by heat and pressure). Precambrian rock outcrops appear
        on some 57 percent of the continent’s surface, while the rest of the surface consists of
        largely undeformed younger sediments and volcanic rocks.
      </p>
     <img src="/img/Mount-Rwenzori.jpg" alt="mount" />
      <p>
        The oldest rocks are of Archean age (i.e., about 4.6 to 2.5 billion years old) and are found in
        the so-called granite-gneiss-greenstone terrains of the Kaapvaal, Zimbabwe, and Congo cratons.
        They consist of gray, banded gneisses, various granitoids, and rather well-preserved volcanic
        rocks that show evidence of submarine extrusion (i.e., emission of rock material in molten form)
        and formation under high temperatures. The rock type komatiite is particularly diagnostic of those
        volcanic sequences and is almost exclusively restricted to the Archean Eon. The cratons were
        tectonically stabilized by voluminous granite intrusions toward the end of the Archean and were
        then covered by clastic sediments, some of which contain economically important gold and uranium
        deposits (e.g., the Witwatersrand System in South Africa).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Proterozoic Eon</b> (2.5 billion to about 541 million years ago) is characterized by the formation
        of several mobile belts, which are long, zones of strongly deformed metamorphosed rocks that occur
        between the cratons and probably resulted from the collision between the cratons due to plate tectonic
        processes. The oldest mobile belts are found in Archean rocks, such as the Limpopo belt separating the
        Kaapvaal from the Zimbabwe craton. Younger belts were formed during a continentwide thermotectonic event
        known as the Eburnian (2.2 to 1.8 billion years ago), which gave rise to the Birimian assemblage in western
        Africa, the Ubendian assemblage in east-central Africa, and large volumes of rocks in Angola. Still younger
        belts of the Kibaran thermotectonic event (1.2 billion to 950 million years ago) are found in eastern and
        Southern Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
        The end of the Precambrian was marked by a major event of mobile-belt formation known as the Pan-African
        episode (about 950 to 550 million years ago), which generated long fold belts, such as the Mozambique
        belt along the east coast of Africa, the Damara and Katanga belts extending from Namibia into the Democratic
        Republic of the Congo and Zambia, the West Congo belt between Angola and Gabon, the Dahomey-Ahaggar belt
        between Ghana and Algeria, and the Mauritanide belt from Senegal to Morocco.
        <br><br>

        A unique late Precambrian evolution is recorded in the so-called Arabian-Nubian Shield of northeastern
        Africa and Arabia. There, large volumes of volcanic and granitoid rocks were generated in an island-arc,
        marginal-basin setting—an environment similar to that of the present southwestern Pacific Ocean.
        Rocks were accreted onto the ancient African continent, the margin of which was then near the present
        Nile River, by subduction processes identical to those observed today. (Subduction involves the descent
        of the edge of one lithospheric plate beneath that of another where two such plates collide.)
        <br><br>
        <img src="/img/geo-tree.jpg" alt="tree">
        The interiors of the ancient cratons were not affected by the above tectonic events, and intracratonic
        sedimentary and volcanic sequences accumulated in large basins. The most important of those are the
        Transvaal basin on the Kaapvaal craton that contains economically important iron ore deposits; the
        Congo basin; and the West African basin, with its thick late Proterozoic sediments including a
        prominent tillite horizon that marks a major glaciation event at the end of the Precambrian.
        </p>
        <p><b>After the Precambrian</b>, Africa’s geologic history is characterized by the following events:
          the formation of fold belts in the Paleozoic Era (about 541 to 252 million years ago) in South
          Africa (the Cape fold belt), Morocco (the Anti-Atlas belt), and Mauritania (the Mauritanide belt)
          bordering the older cratons; voluminous basaltic volcanism some 230 to 200 million years ago in
          South Africa, Namibia, and East Africa, known as the Karoo System, that was probably related to
          the beginning of the breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent; the formation of a young mountain
          belt in northwestern Africa some 100 to 40 million years ago as a result of collision between
          the African and European plates, together with the closure of the ancestral Mediterranean Sea
          (the Tethys Sea); and the development of the East African Rift System during the Cenozoic Era
          (i.e., roughly the past 66 million years), leading to the opening of the Red Sea, the northeast
          drift of the Arabian Plate, and the fracturing of the ancient crust of Africa along several long
          rift valleys, accompanied by extensive volcanism.
        </p>
        <h3>Rock types and structural evolution</h3>
          <h4>The Paleozoic Era</h4>
        <p>The Paleozoic Era consists of the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous,
          and Permian periods and includes two major mountain-building episodes. The continent of Africa
          may be said to have taken shape during the Paleozoic. A glacial period during the Ordovician is
          evidenced by widespread deposition tillites, which may be seen in southern Morocco, throughout
          western Africa, and in subequatorial Africa as far south as Namibia. That tillite sequence marks
          the transition from the end of the Precambrian to the beginning of the Cambrian Period.
        </p>
         <img src="/img/table-mountain.jpg" alt="mountainn">
        <p>
          Marine fossils of the Cambrian Period (about 541 to 485 million years ago) are found in
          southern Morocco, the Western and Mauritanian Sahara, and Namibia. In Egypt and in the
          Arabian Peninsula their presence has been revealed by drilling. Elsewhere they remain unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Ordovician Period (about 485 to 444 million years ago), fossiliferous marine
          sandstone completely covered northern and western Africa, including the Sahara. The Table
          Mountain sandstone of South Africa constitutes its only other trace. That period is, in
          addition, remarkable for broad, large-scale deformation of the African crust, which raised
          the continental table of the central and western Sahara by approximately 5,000 feet
          (1,500 metres). Each emergence resulted in the creation of valleys that became flooded when
          the continent subsided. Toward the end of the period, the Sahara became glaciated, and tillites
          and sandstones filled the valleys. A complete change of sedimentation characterized the Silurian
          Period (about 444 to 419 million years ago), which is indicated by the deposits of graptolitic
          shales (those containing small fossil colonies of extinct marine animals of uncertain zoological
          affinity) in the Arabian Peninsula and in northwestern Africa.<br><br>
          Marine fossils of the Devonian Period (about 419 to 359 million years ago) are found in North
          Africa and in the Sahara. Traces also have been discovered in parts of Guinea, Ghana, and Arabia,
          as well as in Gabon; they also occur in the Bokkeveld Series of South Africa. Fossilized plants
          that include Archaeosigillaria (ancient club mosses) may be traced in formations of the earlier
          Devonian Period in the Sahara and in South Africa (Witteberg Series).
        </p>
          <h4>The Mesozoic Era</h4>
        <p>
          The Mesozoic Era (about 252 to 66 million years ago) is divided into three periods—the Triassic,
          Jurassic, and Cretaceous—and is remarkable for the transgression of ancient seas and for the
          emergence of massive land formations containing interesting fossil remains.<br><br>
          During the Triassic Period (about 252 to 201 million years ago), ancient seas left deposits of
          marine formations in North Africa, the southern Sahara, Egypt, Arabia, and parts of Tanzania and
          northern Madagascar. Deposits from the Jurassic Period (about 201 to 145 million years ago)
          extend to the Atlantic basins of the Río de Oro region of Western Sahara and Senegal along the
          northwest coast of the continent. In the middle of the Jurassic a great transgression of the
          Indian Ocean extended over Somalia and much of Ethiopia. That event was followed by a series
          of marine transgressions in the Cretaceous Period (about 145 to 66 million years ago), including
          those along the coasts of equatorial Africa when Gondwana broke up and the present Atlantic and
          Indian oceans took shape; during one transgression a shallow sea covered much of the northern
          and central Sahara and Egypt as far south as Sudan; and a later one again covered the same areas,
          as well as western Arabia and the west coast of Madagascar.
        </p>
          <h4>The Cenozoic Era</h4>
        <p>
          The Cenozoic, the most recent major interval of geologic time (i.e., the past 66 million years),
          is commonly divided into the Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary periods. The Paleogene and Neogene
          (about 66 to 2.6 million years ago) are remarkable for their great tectonic movements, which
          resulted in the Alpine orogeny. During that mountain-building episode, the Atlas Mountains of
          northwestern Africa were folded and uplifted. Notable too are the formation of the Red Sea rift
          valley and the volcanism and rifting that took place during the later stages of the period.
        </p>
         <img src="/img/atlas_montagne.jpg" alt="atlas">
        <p>
          The initial epoch of the Cenozoic, the Paleocene (about 66 to 56 million years ago), is important
          for its marine formations with animal fossils, including nummulites (a large kind of foraminifera,
          which are unicellular animals of macroscopic size), nautiloids (shelled cephalopods, which are
          mollusks with tentacles attached to their heads), and echinoids (sea urchins); all of those are
          found in North and West Africa and in the Sahara. With the exception of the Sahara, nummulites
          of the Eocene Epoch (about 56 to 34 million years ago) are found in the same places, as well as
          on the African coasts of the Indian Ocean. There also are lepidocyclines (foraminifera) of the
          Oligocene Epoch (about 34 to 23 million years ago) and of the Miocene Epoch (about 23 to 5.3
          million years ago).
        </p>
          <h4>Continental formations</h4>
        <p>
          Several levels may sometimes be distinguished in the continental formations of the Cenozoic Era.
          They include lower Eocene levels containing Pseudoceratodes (a genus of gastropod) and Dyrosaurus
          (a type of reptile), as well as upper Eocene and Oligocene levels containing silicified wood and
          fossilized fish, turtles, crocodiles, snakes, and mammals. In Egypt the Oligocene deposits found
          in the Al-Fayyūm area contain mammals, birds, turtles, and crocodiles. Sediments of the lower
          Miocene, which are found on the banks of Lakes Rudolf and Victoria in East Africa, contain
          mastodon (a large elephant-like mammal) and Proconsul africanus (a large ape). Central Asian
          hipparions (three-toed ancestors of the horse), which simultaneously entered Africa and Europe
          during the late Miocene Epoch (about 11 to 5.3 million years ago), also left their fossilized
          remains in the region, as did genera of hominoid (humanlike) apes—e.g., Kenyapithecus of Kenya—at
          about the same time.
        </p>
            <h4>Tectonic movements</h4>
        <p>
          The first major folding of the Tell Atlas Mountains of North Africa took place in the Oligocene
          Epoch. In the Miocene, North African flysch (thick and extensive deposits composed largely of
          sandstone) formed layers that, from the Rif mountain range of Morocco to northern Tunisia, were
          pushed from the north toward the south. The High Plains area, farther south, which as a whole was
          only mildly deformed, was bounded on the south by the northern Atlas Mountains, which intervened
          between it and the Saharan Atlas. Continental movements lifted the Aurès mountains to a height of
          about 3,300 feet (1,000 metres) during the middle of the Miocene; the Aurès are bounded on the
          south by the northern Sahara structural line, which extends from Agadir in Morocco in the west
          to the Gulf of Gabes in Tunisia in the east, dividing the African Shield from the folded
          Mediterranean, or Alpine, zone.
