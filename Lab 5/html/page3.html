    <h1>People of Africa</h1>
    <img class="top-image" src="/img/thin-pattern.jpg" alt="thin-pattern">
      <p>
        Africa is now widely recognized as the birthplace of the Hominidae,
        the taxonomic family to which modern humans belong.
        Archaeological evidence indicates that the continent has been inhabited by humans
        and their forebears for some 4,000,000 years or more. Anatomically modern humans
        are believed to have appeared as early as 200,000 years ago in the eastern region
        of sub-Saharan Africa. Somewhat later those early humans spread into northern Africa
        and the Middle East and, ultimately, to the rest of the world.

        Dark skin is the dominant characteristic of indigenous African peoples, but skin colour
        is not uniform. Skin colour shows a clinal variation from a light or tan colour in the
        northern fringe of the continent, which has a Mediterranean climate, to very dark skin
        in certain Sudanic regions in western and East Africa, where radiation from the Sun has
        been most intense.
        <br>
        <br>
        Africa has the most physically varied populations in the world, from the
        tallest peoples to the shortest; body form and facial and other morphological features also vary widely.
        It is the continent with the greatest human genetic variation, reflecting its evolutionary role as
        the source of all human DNA.
        <br>

        <br>
        Throughout human history there have been movements of peoples (see human migration) within, into, and out
        of Africa along its northern coasts, across the Sinai Peninsula, along the Red Sea, and especially in the
        Horn of Africa and coastal areas as far south as Southern Africa. North Africa from the Strait of Gibraltar
        to the Nile River delta has been the site of conquests and movements of peoples for thousands of years.
        Along the east coast, trading cities arose and fell, cities that had overseas contacts during the past two
        millennia with peoples of southern Arabia and as far east as India and Indonesia.
        <br>
        <br>
        Internal movements during that time contributed to the heterogeneity and complexity of native African societies.
        The greatest movement of peoples out of the continent was a result of the Atlantic slave trade that lasted from
        the 16th to the 19th century and involved the transport of an estimated 10,000,000 people to the New World.
        Such a loss of people, together with the devastating warfare and raiding associated with it, was the major
        cause of the subsequent weakness and decline of African societies.

      <p>
        Whereas the majority of Africa’s peoples are indigenous, European colonial settlers constitute the largest
        majority of new peoples, with substantial numbers in Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia, and
        Mozambique.Dutch settlers first arrived in South Africa in 1652; their descendants now constitute the main
        Afrikaner, or Boer, population. The vast majority of European settlers arrived after the 1885 Berlin West Africa
        Conference and the resulting “scramble for Africa,” during which European leaders carved out spheres of influence.
        <br>
        <br>
        Attendant, but unassociated, with the scramble, French and Italian settlers also established new communities in
        North Africa and, to some extent, western Africa. Much earlier, in several waves of migrations beginning in the
        7th century, Arabs spread across northern Africa and, to a lesser extent, into western Africa, bringing a new
        religion (Islam) and a new language (Arabic), along with some new cultural and political institutions. <br> They also
        spread Islam southward along the east coast, largely through trading and kinship relationships. The colonial era began to disintegrate in the 1950s.
      </p>
    <h3>Culture areas</h3>
      <p>
        Although the precise number is unknown, there are several thousand different societies or ethnic groups in Africa.
        They are identified by their recognition of a common culture, language, religion, and history.
        But in some areas the boundaries among ethnic groups and communities (villages, towns, farm areas)
        may not always be clear to the outsider. Most Africans speak more than one language, and frequent migrations
        and interactions, including intermarriage, with other peoples have often blurred ethnic distinctions.
        <br><br>
        There are an estimated 900 to 1,500 different languages, but many distinct political units share a common
        or similar language (as among the Yoruba, Hausa, and Swahili-speaking peoples). Complicating the situation
        in the 20th century was the creation of new “tribes” (such as the Zande [Azande] and Luo) that had not been
        distinct polities before the colonial era. Ethnic (cultural) identities in modern times have often been heightened,
        exacerbated, or muted for political reasons.

    <h3>Northern Africa</h3>
      <p>
        Africa north of the Sahara is differentiated from the rest of the continent by its Mediterranean climate
        and by its long history of political and cultural contacts with peoples outside of Africa. It is physically
        separated from the rest of the continent by the Atlas Mountains and is inhabited primarily by peoples who
        speak languages that belong to the Afro-Asiatic group.<br> Those peoples include, for example, the Imazighen
        (Berbers) of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. The Berbers are most numerous in Morocco and least in Tunisia,
        where, as a result of culture contact and intermarriage, they have become largely assimilated with Arabs,
        who speak a Semitic language.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Arabs migrated into North Africa from Arabia in a number of waves; the first of those waves occurred
        in the 7th century CE. The distinctive nature of Maghrebian, or western Arab, culture resulted from that
        admixture. In the Sahara such Arab peoples as the Shuwa live side by side with such Berber peoples as
        the Tuareg. See also Islamic world.
      </p>
    <h3>Western Africa</h3>
    <img src="/img/westAfrica.jpg" alt="west">
      <p>
        Western Africa contains a remarkable diversity of ethnic groups. It can be divided into two zones,
        the Sudanic savanna and the Guinea Coast. The savanna area stretches for some 3,000 miles (4,800 km)
        east to west along the southern Saharan borderland. Its vegetation consists of extensive grasslands
        and few forests, and little rain falls there. <br> The savanna supports pastoralism and horticultural
        economies dependent on grain. In contrast, the Guinea Coast experiences heavy rainfall and is
        characterized by hardwood tropical forests and dense foliage. It produces primarily root crops
        (various yams).
      </p>
    <p>
      Among the more important of the savanna peoples are the three main clusters known as Mande in Senegal
      and Mali and including the Bambara, Malinke, and Soninke; the Gur-speaking group in the savanna zone
      to the east that includes the Senufo, Lobi, Dogon, and Moore; and in northern Nigeria, Niger, and
      Cameroon the many small, mainly non-Muslim tribes of the plateau and highland areas. <br>Throughout the
      region live the many groups of the Fulani, a cattle-keeping Muslim people who either have conquered
      indigenous peoples (such as the numerous Hausa) or live in a symbiotic relationship with agricultural
      peoples. In the Sahara fringe are the many Berber-speaking groups (collectively known as the Tuareg),
      the Kanuri of Lake Chad, and the Bedouin Arab peoples. Many of the kingdoms are successor states to
      those of Ghana and Mali.
    </p>
    <p>
      The larger societies in the coastal zone are also mostly kingdoms. In Nigeria are the Igbo and Ibibio,
      organized into many autonomous polities; the Tiv; the Edo; and the several powerful kingdoms of the
      Yoruba. Westward are the Fon of Benin; the various peoples of the Akan confederacy, mostly in Ghana,
      the largest group being the Asante; the Ewe, Ga, Fante, and Anyi of the coast; the Mende and Temne
      of Sierra Leone; the Kru of Liberia; the Wolof, Serer, Dyula, and others of Senegal; and the Creoles
      of Sierra Leone and Liberia, descendants of freed slaves from the New World or of those who were on
      their way there.
